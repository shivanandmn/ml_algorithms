#### Implement a function to calculate the L2 norm of a vector. ####

- L1 norm is the sum of the absolute value of the entries in the vector. 
- L2 norm is the square root of the sum of the entries of the vector. 

In general, the Lp norm is the pth root of the sum of the entries of the vector raised to the pth power.

$$\begin{split}\|x\|_1&=\sum |x_i|\\
\|x\|_2&=\sqrt{\sum x_i^2}\\
\|x\|_p&=(\sum |x_i|^p)^{1/p}\end{split}$$


* In ML L2 norm is used as a `regularization method` to prevent overfitting of the model.
* Distance metric to calculate the similarity between two vectors.
* In optmization, the L2 norm is used as a penalty term to contrain the size of the coefficients of the model.
* In linear algebra, L2 is used to calculate the magnitude or length of a vector.
